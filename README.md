# React on Hanami (Bootstrap 5)

Welcome to the React on Hanami (with Bootstrap 5 CSS) Template!

I made this template so that you can quickly get started with developing an app on Hanami.

## Background Info

This template uses Esbuild to compile Javascript and JSX files and output the bundled JS and CSS to /public/assets folder. It also uses Foreman to run both the Shotgun development server (which allows code reloading, see [here](https://guides.hanamirb.org/v1.3/projects/code-reloading/)) and the Esbuild script that will watch for any changes in the JS / JSX files and then recompile accordingly.

Unfortunately, a 'hot reloading' feature like with Webpack does not work in this setup (as far as I can tell) - this means that while the server is running, you have to reload the page to see changes you made after Esbuild recompiles the JS/JSX files.

Versions:

- Bootstrap: ^5.1.3,
- Esbuild: ^0.14.9,
- React: ^17.0.2,
- React-dom: ^17.0.2

### Important (Heroku):
If you are trying to deploy this app to heroku, the current config will not work because it uses sqlite3. For heroku, you need a Hanami app with postgresql (you can use `hanami new my_app --database=postgresql` as per the Hanami guides). However, when you do that and still want to use esbuild / foreman to run the development environment, you need to run postgresql locally (heroku will automatically deploy its own when you push the app there). To do that, you can take a look at these two posts ([Link 1](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-postgresql-on-ubuntu-20-04-quickstart),  [Link 2](https://medium.com/@vonchristian/setup-hanami-with-postgresql-604f08d4a1eb)) that I found helpful (you will be updating the DATABASE_URL in .env.development and .env.test to set this up).

I hope this will help you get started with Hanami. Let me know if anything is wrong / does not work!

## Get started with the template

When you clone this repo, run the following commands:

```
% bundle install
```

and

```
% yarn
```

To enter the development server (default on: http://localhost:3000/ - you can change it in Procfile.dev), run:

```
% foreman start
```

To shut down the server - Ctrl + C.

FYI: I have deleted the secret from .env.development and .env.test - these would have to be replaced with your own, as I do not have an installer for this repo.

## Setup (Hanami)

How to run tests:

```
% bundle exec rake
```

How to run the development console:

```
% bundle exec hanami console
```

How to run the development server:

```
% bundle exec hanami server
```

How to prepare (create and migrate) DB for `development` and `test` environments:

```
% bundle exec hanami db prepare

% HANAMI_ENV=test bundle exec hanami db prepare
```
